# Contributing Guide

## Project Overview

DaSite is a Node.js CLI tool that helps developers test websites by capturing screenshots, crawling sites, and comparing changes over time. It uses Playwright for browser automation.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dasite.git
   cd dasite
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run in development mode

   ```bash
   node index.js http://example.com
   ```

## Project Structure

- `/index.js` - Main entry point for the CLI
- `/lib/` - Core functionality modules
- `/server.js` - Test server for development and testing

## Output Directory Structure

**IMPORTANT:** All snapshot and output files MUST be saved to the `/dasite` directory, not to custom directories. This includes:

- Screenshots
- Baseline images
- Comparison results
- HTML reports

DO NOT create or use directories like `/output`, `/test-output`, etc. All file output operations should target the project's root directory.

## Technologies

DaSite is built with:

- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Playwright** - Browser automation for capturing screenshots
- **Express** - Test server for local testing
- **Node.js Test Runner** - For testing functionality

## Testing

DaSite uses Node.js's built-in test runner. Tests focus on real user behavior rather than using mocks or fixtures.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
node --test tests/some-test.js
```

### Test File Naming Conventions

- One test file per task from the roadmap
- Files in the `/tests` directory should include the roadmap task number prefix followed by `.test.` (e.g., `1.screenshot.test.js`)
- Using `.test.` in filenames provides better editor integration (changes icons in VSCode)
- Test filenames should clearly indicate what functionality they're testing

### Test Server

Tests use the `server.js` module which provides a simple express server for testing. The server can be configured with:

- `TEST_SERVER_PORT` - Default is 3000
- `TEST_SERVER_HOST` - Default is localhost

Example:

```bash
# Run tests with custom server configuration
TEST_SERVER_PORT=8080 TEST_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1 npm test
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Follow the coding style of the project
3. Include tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Keep PRs focused on a single issue/feature

## Code Style

The project follows ES Module patterns and modern JavaScript practices:

- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Use ES Modules (import/export) rather than CommonJS
- Maintain clear module boundaries and single responsibilities
