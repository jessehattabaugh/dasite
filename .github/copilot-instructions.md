# Copilot Instructions

Use Node.js, JavaScript and JSON. Avoid Typescript and YAML. Use JSDocs to define types. Don't create any *.ts files except *.d.ts files. Keep all typedefs in *.d.ts files. Don't create *.tsx files. Keep your solutions simple and focus on one thing at a time. Use spaces for indentation. Use destructuring, and object literal shorthand to avoid creating new identifiers. Use async/await, and Promises. Do not create unecessary functions; functions must have at least three callsites, or be passed as a continuation or callback. Functions are not for organization, ES Modules are. Use ES Modules when available and avoid CommonJS. Do not create generic "utils" or "helpers" modules. Each module must have a clear and narrow purpose. Keep names short, and consistent.
